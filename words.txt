Mapper maps input key/value pairs to a set of intermediate key/value pairs.
Maps are the individual tasks that transform input records into intermediate records.
The transformed intermediate records do not need to be of the same type as the input records.
A given input pair may map to zero or many output pairs.
The Hadoop MapReduce framework spawns one map task for each InputSplit generated by the InputFormat for the job.
